About
~~~~~~~~

MusicBucket Bot is a Telegram Bot that adds features and possibility to interact with **Spotify** music links that users send in
a chat.

Its main feature is to allow you to **save links that someones shares in a Chat** in a personal list.
So you can easily track which music you have pending to listen to.

When an user sends a link, the bot is able to get information from a Spotify link like:

-  *Artist*
-  *Album*
-  *Track*
-  *Genres*
-  *Audio preview*

It also integrates with **Last.fm** to retrieve information about your
user like **Now Playing**.

Why Telegram?
_____________
I chose Telegram because I'm in a few groups where we share music everyday. We soon realized that
the links we shared in a group were often missed. Therefore, the idea of making a tool for keeping track
of the music we share started growing so I started developing this bot.

Why Spotify?
_____________
At the start the bot supported both Spotify and Deezer, but Spotify is the platform that we use
mostly, so implementing new features for both platforms became complicated and I decided supporting Spotify
only.
